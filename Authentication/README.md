# Authentication

Authentication is a process that ensures and confirms a user's identity. In the context of computer systems, it is usually performed before authorization, which is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or functions.

## **Authentication Protocols**

1. **HTTP Basic Authentication**: This is the simplest method, where the client sends a username and password with each HTTP request. The credentials are concatenated with a colon (username:password) and then base64 encoded (not encrypted), and sent in the Authorization HTTP header.
2. **Digest Authentication**: Similar to HTTP Basic Authentication but more secure as it involves a server-side nonce that the client combines with the username, password, and other details to generate a hashed value.
3. **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: These protocols are used to secure communications over networks. While not authentication protocols per se, they provide a mechanism to authenticate the server to the client and optionally, the client to the server.
4. **Kerberos**: A network authentication protocol that uses secret-key cryptography for secure, trusted third-party authentication.
5. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**: An open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, specifically between an identity provider and a service provider.
6. **OAuth**: An open standard for token-based authentication and authorization which allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.
7. **OpenID Connect**: A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

  

## **Authentication Flows**

1. **Password-Based Authentication**: The most traditional form where a user provides a username and password.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: An extra layer of security where the user has to provide two types of identification. This is usually something the user knows (like a password) and something the user has (like a unique code sent to a phone).
3. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to log in once and gain access to a variety of other systems without being prompted to log in again.
4. **OAuth 2.0 Flows**: OAuth 2.0 provides several "grant types" for different use cases, including authorization code for apps running on a web server, implicit for browser-based or mobile apps, password for logging in with a username and password, and client credentials for application API access.

  

## **Authentication Providers**

1. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: Used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over an Internet protocol network.
2. **Active Directory**: A directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type network.
3. **OAuth Providers**: Services like Google, Facebook, and Twitter allow third-party applications to authenticate users through their platforms using the OAuth protocol.
4. **SAML Providers**: Various services offer SAML-based single sign-on and identity federation. Examples include Okta, OneLogin, and Microsoft's Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).
5. **Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) Providers**: These are third-party services that handle identity management for other companies. Examples include Okta, Microsoft Azure AD, and AWS Cognito.

  

## **Use Cases**

1. **HTTP Basic and Digest Authentication**: Used for simple username/password access to web resources, often in controlled environments or for simple scripts.
2. **SSL/TLS**: Used for nearly all secure communication on the internet, including web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP (VoIP).
3. **Kerberos**: Used in various corporate and educational environments for secure identification of users

  

# Federated Authentication

Federated Authentication is a method of identity management that allows users to use the same credentials (username, password, etc.) to log in to multiple different systems or applications. In this process, the systems or applications trust each other to authenticate users, rather than having each system authenticate users separately.

  

The way it works is that one system, known as the Identity Provider (IdP), is responsible for storing and verifying users' credentials. Other systems, known as Service Providers (SPs), trust the Identity Provider and allow users who have been authenticated by the Identity Provider to access their services. This arrangement is the "federation" of authentication.

  

For example, if you've ever used your Google account to sign in to a non-Google service (like a news website or a game), you've used federated authentication. In this case, Google is the Identity Provider and the other service is the Service Provider.

  

The underlying protocols that support this type of authentication include:

1. **OAuth**: An open standard for access delegation, used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
2. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

  

Federated Authentication is based on open standards and protocols like SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), OAuth, and OpenID Connect, which define the ways in which identity information is exchanged between the Identity Provider and the Service Providers. When you attempt to access a service, the Service Provider requests an identity assertion from the Identity Provider. If you're already authenticated with the Identity Provider (like if you're already signed in to your Google account), the Identity Provider sends an assertion to the Service Provider to confirm your identity. If you're not already authenticated, the Identity Provider will prompt you to sign in first.

  

Federated Authentication has several benefits:

1. **Convenience**: Users only need to remember a single set of credentials, and they don't need to sign in separately to each service they use.
2. **Reduced administrative overhead**: Because user identities are managed centrally by the Identity Provider, Service Providers don't need to handle tasks like user registration, password resets, or account recovery.
3. **Improved security**: Federated authentication can reduce the risk of password reuse across multiple services, and it allows security features like multi-factor authentication or suspicious activity detection to be implemented centrally by the Identity Provider.
