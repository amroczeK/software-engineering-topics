# ASP.NET Core

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core is a powerful and flexible framework with many built-in concepts, patterns, and features that help you build efficient and secure web applications. Here are some key ones that you should be familiar with:

1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern**:

This is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. Models contain or represent the data, views display the user interface and data, and controllers handle the user input.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core comes with built-in support for dependency injection, allowing you to develop loosely coupled, testable components. Services (like database contexts, or your own service classes) are registered in the DI container in the Startup class and then can be injected into controllers or other services.

3. **Middleware**:

In [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core, middleware is software that's assembled into an application's pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each component in the pipeline chooses whether to pass the request on to the next component in the pipeline, and can perform certain actions before and after the next component is invoked.

4. **Razor Pages**:

Razor Pages is a feature of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive. It's a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive.

5. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**:

EF Core is a lightweight, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework, the popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET.

6. **API Development**:

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core allows you to build RESTful services using [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web API. You should understand how to build controllers, actions, understand routing, status codes, and how to version APIs.

7. **Authentication and Authorization**:

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core provides a flexible system for controlling access to your app, including user login with a variety of providers (like cookies or tokens for a REST API), social logins, and OAuth2.

8. **Configuration**:

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core uses a simple configuration system that's easily extendable. It can pull configuration data from JSON files, environment variables, command line arguments, or any custom source.

9. **Logging**:

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core includes simple logging APIs that work with a variety of built-in and third-party logging providers. Logging is especially important for diagnostics and troubleshooting.

10. **Environment Variables**:

Understanding the role of environment variables in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core applications is essential. They are used to set environment-specific settings such as development, staging, and production.

11. **Data Validation**:

Data validation in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core can be performed using Data Annotations, which allow you to specify validation rules using attributes on your model classes.

12. **Testing**:

Knowledge of unit testing and integration testing in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core is also critical. Familiarity with libraries such as xUnit, NUnit or MSTest, and Moq for mocking, can be very helpful.

  

# .NET Framework

## Concepts

There are several key concepts that are essential to understanding and working effectively with .NET. Here are some of the most important:

1. **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**: The CLR is the execution engine for .NET applications, providing services such as memory management, garbage collection, security, and exception handling.
2. **Framework Class Library (FCL)**: The .NET FCL, also known as the Base Class Library (BCL), is a large collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide fundamental functionality to .NET applications.
3. **C# Language Basics**: Understanding the syntax and features of C#, such as classes, objects, methods, properties, inheritance, and interfaces, is fundamental to working with .NET.
4. [**ASP.NET**](http://ASP.NET) **Core**: This is the framework used for building web applications, web APIs, and microservices. Understanding how to use it, and its Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, is crucial.
5. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: EF Core is the preferred Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for .NET. It allows developers to interact with databases using .NET objects.
6. **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: LINQ is a powerful feature in .NET that allows you to work with data in a more intuitive way, regardless of the data source.
7. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: DI is a design pattern used heavily in .NET to achieve loosely coupled code. It's a method of passing dependencies (objects) to other objects.
8. **Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)**: Asynchronous programming is crucial in .NET to free up the main thread while waiting for a long-running operation to complete.
9. **Unit Testing**: .NET has a strong emphasis on testing, with tools like MSTest, [xUnit.net](http://xUnit.net), and NUnit, and the ability to mock dependencies using tools like Moq.
10. **.NET CLI**: The .NET Command Line Interface is a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications.
11. **Blazor**: This is a framework for building interactive client-side web apps with .NET and C# instead of JavaScript.
12. **Microservices Architecture**: With the rise of cloud computing, understanding how to design and develop microservices using .NET is increasingly important.
13. **.NET 5 and .NET 6**: These recent versions of .NET aim to unify the platform, bringing .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin, and Mono together. Understanding the differences between these versions and how to migrate from older versions is essential.

These are foundational concepts, but remember that .NET is a vast platform with many features and capabilities. Depending on what you're doing with .NET, you may need to understand other concepts and tools as well.

  

## Serialization and Deserialization

**Serialization:** Converting an object into a stream of bytes or plain-text data.

**Deserialization:** Converting back from serialized data stream into original object.

  

**Serialization** is the process of converting an object's state (including its public and private fields) to a format that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. The serialized format includes the assembly name and object data. The opposite process, converting a serialized format back into a living object, is known as deserialization.

  

Example using the `System.Text.Json` namespace:

```plain
csharp
// A simple class to demonstrate serializationpublic class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

// Create an object
Person person = new Person
{
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "Doe"
};

// Serialize the object to a JSON stringstring jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(person);
Console.WriteLine(jsonString);
// Output: {"FirstName":"John","LastName":"Doe"}// Deserialize the JSON string back into a Person object
Person deserializedPerson = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Person>(jsonString);
Console.WriteLine($"{deserializedPerson.FirstName} {deserializedPerson.LastName}");
// Output: John Doe
```

In this example, the `JsonSerializer.Serialize` method converts a `Person` object into a JSON string, and the `JsonSerializer.Deserialize` method converts the JSON string back into a `Person` object.

  

The `System.Text.Json` namespace is not the only option for serialization and deserialization in .NET. The `Newtonsoft.Json` package is a popular alternative, especially in older .NET Framework and .NET Core applications, and offers a more feature-rich API.

  

It's also worth noting that while JSON is a common format for serialization, it's not the only option.

  

You can also serialize objects to XML, binary, or your own custom formats. And .NET offers built-in support for all of these through the `System.Xml.Serialization` and `System.Runtime.Serialization` namespaces.

  

  

## Design Patterns

1. **Repository Pattern**: The repository pattern abstracts the data store's details and operations into a separate repository class. The rest of the application can then interact with the repository to perform CRUD operations, decoupling the data access logic from the business logic.

  

2. **Unit of Work Pattern**: The unit of work pattern is often used in conjunction with the repository pattern. It maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes. It ensures a single database transaction per request.

  

3. **Factory Pattern**: The factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's commonly used with Dependency Injection in .NET.

  

4. **Singleton Pattern**: The singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In .NET Core and .NET 6, the DI container manages singleton lifetime services.

  

5. **Strategy Pattern**: This pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. For instance, it can be used in a payment processing system where the payment method (Credit Card, PayPal, etc.) can be selected at runtime.

  

6. **Observer Pattern**: The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes. This pattern is the principle behind Event Handling in .NET.

  

7. **Decorator Pattern**: This pattern adds new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This is a structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing classes.

  

8. **Mediator Pattern**: The Mediator Pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly. This pattern is frequently used in modern .NET applications with libraries such as MediatR.

  

9. **Command Pattern**: The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

  

10. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern**: CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates reading and writing into different models. This allows read and write operations to be scaled separately and can optimize for the specific demands of each operation. This pattern is often combined with Event Sourcing.

  

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique where an object receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. The lifetime of these dependencies is managed by the .NET DI container and they can be configured to behave as Transient, Scoped, or Singleton.

*   DI is a design pattern used heavily in .NET to achieve loosely coupled code. It's a method of passing dependencies (objects) to other objects.

  

1. **Transient**: Transient lifetime services (AddTransient) are created each time they're requested from the service container. This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.

  

**Example**: Suppose you have a service class `NotificationService` that sends notifications to users. Each notification might go to a different user and include different content. In this case, it's beneficial for each request for a `NotificationService` to get a new instance, so the state (recipient, content, etc.) from one notification doesn't affect another. Here, Transient lifetime is suitable.

  

2. **Scoped**: Scoped lifetime services (AddScoped) are created once per client request (connection). This means that if multiple objects depend on a scoped service, they'll all get the same instance for a given request, but different requests will receive different instances.

  

**Example**: Let's consider a `ShoppingCartService` in an e-commerce web application. This service is responsible for managing the shopping cart for a user during a single web session. We want the service to persist the state (the items in the cart) during the session, so the same `ShoppingCartService` instance should be used throughout the session. However, different users should get different `ShoppingCartService` instances. Here, a Scoped lifetime is suitable.

  

3. **Singleton**: Singleton lifetime services (AddSingleton) are created the first time they're requested, or if you specify an instance when the service is added to the container. Every subsequent request will use the same instance. If the application requires singleton behavior, allowing the services container to manage the service's lifetime is recommended instead of implementing the singleton design pattern and managing the object's lifetime in the class with static methods.

  

**Example**: Consider a `ConfigurationService` that reads some configuration data from a file or a database when the application starts. Reading configuration data can be an expensive operation, so you want to do it only once, and then use the same configuration data for all requests. Here, a Singleton lifetime is suitable.

  

## Securing API's

.NET 6 APIs can be secured using various techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication, OAuth, OpenID Connect, and built-in Identity systems. In addition, you can also implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), use HTTPS for secure communication, and implement authorization policies and roles to control access.

  

**Role-based authorization** in .NET is a security model where permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned roles. A role represents a group of privileges. By assigning users to roles, you can easily control which users have access to which resources or functionality.

  

Let's consider a simple example of a web application with two roles: "Admin" and "User".

  

**Step 1: Configure Role-Based Authorization**

First, you need to configure the Identity services in the `Startup.cs` class.

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

    services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
        .AddRoles<IdentityRole>() // Add Roles
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();

    services.AddControllersWithViews();
    services.AddRazorPages();
}
```

  

**Step 2: Assign Roles to Users**

Next, you can assign roles to users when they are registered or anytime after that. The following code assigns the "Admin" role to a new user:

```cs
var user = new IdentityUser { UserName = model.Email, Email = model.Email };
var result = await _userManager.CreateAsync(user, model.Password);
if (result.Succeeded)
{
    await _userManager.AddToRoleAsync(user, "Admin"); // Assign role
}
```

  

**Step 3: Use Authorize Attribute**

Finally, you can use the `[Authorize]` attribute to enforce role-based authorization in your controllers or action methods. The following code restricts access to the `AdminController` to users with the "Admin" role:

```cs
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public class AdminController : Controller
{
    // Your action methods go here
}
```

Now, only users assigned the "Admin" role can access the methods in the `AdminController`. Users in the "User" role, or unauthenticated users, will be denied access.

  

Remember, you can also check a user's roles programmatically by calling the `UserManager.IsInRoleAsync` method, and you can use policy-based authorization for more complex authorization requirements. Role-based authorization is just one part of a comprehensive security strategy.

  

# Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that centers the design and the development process around the domain—the subject area the software is intended to address. The main goal of DDD is to create a software model that provides solutions for specific business domains.

  

DDD contains a rich set of technical practices and strategic design principles, but at its heart are three core concepts:

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: This is a common language used by all team members—both technical and non-technical—to describe the domain and the software models. The idea is to eliminate or minimize misunderstanding between team members. The ubiquitous language is used everywhere—in discussions, in diagrams, in code.
2. **Bounded Contexts**: These are logical boundaries within which a model applies. In complex systems, no single model can effectively cover all areas. By defining bounded contexts, we can create a number of smaller, more manageable models, each applying within its own context.
3. **Strategic Design**: This concept concerns how different bounded contexts interact and how they fit into the larger system. It includes considerations about shared kernels (common models shared between contexts), customer-supplier relationships (where one context supplies data to another), and anti-corruption layers (which translate between different contexts to prevent one model from corrupting another).

  

**Let's consider an example:**

Suppose you're building a software system for a library. The domain includes concepts such as "Book", "Member", "Loan", etc.

  

The **Ubiquitous Language** here would use these terms. For example, a "Loan" might refer to the event of a "Member" borrowing a "Book". Everyone on the team, from the software developers to the library staff, would use these terms in discussions and design.

  

The system might have several **Bounded Contexts**. For example, one context might deal with membership management (signing up new members, renewing memberships, etc.), another with inventory management (adding new books, removing damaged books, etc.), and another with loan management (loaning books, returning books, tracking overdue loans, etc.). Each context has its own model that is valid within that context. For example, the "Member" in the membership management context might include data about the member's contact information and membership status, while the "Member" in the loan management context might include data about the member's current and past loans.

  

The **Strategic Design** might dictate that the membership management context is the authoritative source of member data. The loan management context might need some of this data, but to prevent corruption of its model, it might use an anti-corruption layer to translate from the membership context's model to its own. The loan management context might also be a customer of the inventory management context, using data from it to keep track of which books are currently available for loan.

  

DDD is especially valuable in complex domains, where a deep understanding of the domain is crucial to the success of the software. It's less suitable for simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications or domains where the business rules are simple and unlikely to change.

  

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

*   Improved Communication: The ubiquitous language improves communication within the team and with stakeholders.
*   Handles Complexity: It provides techniques to manage complexity in business logic.
*   Focus on Core Business: It puts the focus on the core business, making it easier to align the software with business needs.

**Cons:**

*   Overkill for Simple Domains: DDD can be overkill for simple applications with little domain complexity.
*   Learning Curve: It can be hard to learn and correctly implement, especially strategic patterns.
*   Requires Domain Expertise: It requires close collaboration with domain experts.

  

# Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a **design pattern** used in **software architecture**. In traditional data management systems, the most recent state of each piece of data is stored, and each change overwrites the previous state.

  

With **Event Sourcing**, instead of storing just the current state, all changes (events) to the **application state are stored in an event store**. This approach **allows you to reconstruct past states** and also helps with **debugging**, **auditing**, and sometimes even in feature implementation.

  

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Events**: An event is something that has happened in the past. Events are facts, and once recorded, they cannot be changed or deleted. For example, "Order Placed", "Item Shipped", "Payment Processed" are all events.
2. **Event Store**: This is the storage where all the events are stored. It's like a database, but it's optimized for appending events and reading a sequence of events for a particular entity.
3. **Event Stream**: A sequence of events for an entity is known as an event stream. Each entity has its own event stream.
4. **Aggregates**: Aggregate corresponds to a stream of events. When you want to modify an Aggregate, you load its event stream and apply all the events to recreate its current state. This is often called rehydrating the aggregate. Once you have the current state, you can execute a command on it, which may result in new events that you append to the event stream.
5. **Command**: A command is a request to perform an action, which could lead to an event.
6. **Read Model / Projection**: To query the application state, we need a read model. This model can be built by applying all the events (this process is known as a projection).

  

**Here's a simple example:**

**Consider an online shopping system.**

1. A customer places an order. This action results in an "OrderPlaced" event, which gets stored in the event store.
2. The customer makes a payment. This action results in a "PaymentMade" event, which also gets stored.
3. The order is shipped. This action results in an "OrderShipped" event, again stored.

  

Each of these events is part of the event stream for this particular order. The current state of the order (whether it's placed, paid, shipped, etc.) is derived from this event stream.

  

If we want to see the state of the order at any point in time, we can do so by replaying the events up to that point. For example, to get the state of the order after the payment but before it was shipped, we replay the "OrderPlaced" and "PaymentMade" events.

  

The major advantage of event sourcing is that it preserves the full history of changes, not just the current state. This can be very valuable for systems where auditing or historical analysis is important. It's also a natural fit for systems based on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**.

  

## Pros and Cons

Pros:

*   Auditability: Since all changes to the application state are stored as a sequence of events, you have a complete log of everything that has ever happened.
*   Temporal Query: You can determine the state of the system at any point in time.
*   Replay Events: You can use the event log to reconstruct the system state, debug issues that happened in the past, or test how changes in the business logic would have affected the past outcome.
*   Event-Driven: It works well with event-driven and microservices architectures.

Cons:

*   Complexity: Implementing event sourcing adds complexity to your application.
*   Event Versioning: Over time, the structure of your events may change, and handling event versioning can be tricky. You can create a transformation/translation later to transform old versions to the new version.
*   Performance: Depending on the volume of events, replaying them to reconstruct the current state could be slow.

  

# **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a software architectural pattern that separates the models that read data (queries) from the models that update data (commands). This separation can help to maintain code simplicity, reduce conflicts in complex business logic, and improve performance, scalability, and security.

  

**Here's a brief explanation of the two main parts of CQRS:**

1. **Commands** represent the intent to mutate data. They are named in the imperative and can fail if the system was unable to complete the action. For example, "PlaceOrder", "ShipOrder", and "MakePayment" could all be commands in an e-commerce system.
2. **Queries** are requests to read data. They do not change the state of the system and are free of side effects. Queries might include "GetOrderStatus", "ListCustomerOrders", or "GetOrderTotal".

  

**_A traditional CRUD-style application combines these two operations, often in the same model or database schema. CQRS suggests separating them, allowing you to optimize the read side (queries) and the write side (commands) independently._**

  

**Let's illustrate this with a simple example:**

Suppose you're building an online blog platform. The **command** side handles operations like creating a new blog post, editing an existing post, or deleting a post. Each of these commands involves changing the system's state.

  

The **query** side, on the other hand, handles operations like displaying a blog post, listing all posts by a particular user, or showing the most popular posts. These queries don't change the system's state; they only read from it.

  

By separating these responsibilities, you could optimize each side for its specific type of operation. For instance, you might store the complete text of each blog post in a document database that's optimized for the "display a blog post" query, while storing metadata about each post in a relational database that's optimized for complex queries like "show the most popular posts".

  

**Now, how does CQRS relate to Event Sourcing?**

Event Sourcing and CQRS are often used together, though they can also be used separately. When used together, they form a powerful combination that can handle complex domains and provide benefits like high performance, scalability, and auditability.

  

**In a system using both Event Sourcing and CQRS:**

*   The write model (commands) handles events. When a command comes in (like "PlaceOrder"), the system generates an event (like "OrderPlaced") and stores it in the event store.
*   The read model (queries) is generated by processing the events. The current state of any entity (like the status of an order) is derived by replaying the events related to that entity.

  

This architecture allows the read model to be very flexible. You can create multiple read models for different purposes, all from the same set of events. For instance, you could have one read model optimized for displaying order status to a customer, another optimized for reporting and analytics, and so on. Because the read models are separate from the write model, they can be scaled independently based on the needs of the application.

  

One thing to note is that this architecture introduces some complexity, as you need to handle event propagation and eventual consistency (since the write and read models are updated asynchronously). As with any architectural decision, it's important to consider the trade-offs and make sure that CQRS and Event Sourcing are a good fit for your particular application and its requirements.

  

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

*   Scalability: Since the read and write sides are separated, they can be scaled independently.
*   Optimization: Each side (read/write) can be optimized for its specific type of operations.
*   Flexibility: Different data storage technologies can be used on the command and query sides depending on the needs.

**Cons:**

*   Complexity: It adds more complexity to your system design.
*   Data Consistency: It can lead to eventual consistency issues, as the write and read databases are updated asynchronously.
